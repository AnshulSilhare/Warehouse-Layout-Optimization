# 🏭 Warehouse Layout Optimization: Flow Engineering

## Executive Summary
This project involved redesigning a traditional warehouse facility to resolve critical bottlenecks, reduce cross-traffic congestion, and improve overall material flow efficiency. By applying **Lean Principles**, the new design segregates operations to maximize throughput.

## 🚧 The Problem: "Spaghetti" Flow
The baseline layout suffered from:
1.  **Process Overlap:** Inbound and Outbound teams shared the same staging area, causing congestion.
2.  **Excessive Travel:** High-velocity SKUs were stored far from packing stations.
3.  **Safety Risks:** Forklift paths intersected frequently with pedestrian packing zones.

## 🏗️ The Solution: Zoning & Cross-Docking
I implemented a three-pronged optimization strategy:

| Strategy | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Zoning Optimization** | Restructured the facility into distinct **Inbound (Receiving)** and **Outbound (Shipping)** zones to eliminate process overlap. |
| **2. Flow Engineering** | Implemented a centralized **"Cross-Dock" conveyor system** to seamlessly connect bulk storage to packing stations. |
| **3. ABC Analysis** | Relocated "Fast Mover" (Category A) SKUs closer to the conveyor belt to minimize picker travel time. |

## 🚀 Operational Impact
- **Throughput:** Theoretical capacity increased by **20%** compared to the baseline.
- **Safety:** Forklift traffic is now physically segregated from pedestrian packing zones.
- **Scalability:** Modular staging areas allow for volume surges during peak season without disrupting core operations.
